# MILKPATCHED
RJW's milkable colonists - Now with less absurd debuffs, more milk, overfilled breasts and quicker growth.


Notable changes:

LACT-X, LACT-MAX & HYPER LACT-MAX no longer fucking cripple your pawns.
I mean, hyper LACT-MAX still does the brain damage thing because I think it's neat and is actually balanced instead of just kneecapping your pawns for fun, but they no longer cap your pawns consciousness/manipulation just because their tits are leaking milk.
They still cause temporary trouble with manipulation and moving at first consumption, but it settles down once the high wears off.
Only hyper LACT-MAX still has some permanent debuff beyond the brain damage, but it's just -10% to mov & man, so you can counter it with go-juice, bionics, neural supercharge or whatever other shit you have to increase those numbers.

Milk output significantly increased. Like, it's almost 3x more milk than default.
You can almost feed a colony off it's own milk if they're all women, but then again this mod is 50% to jack off, so it's not like realism is a big deal.
Still, if you care enough to change it, it's just the RaceMilkPatch.xml, just look in there, find the milkamount (currently 36, originally 12) and change all 3 instances to the amount you want, restart rimworld and voila.
Don't particularly understand how a racepatch alters the output for regular humans too, but I'm not complaining.

Changed breast growth due to breasts being over max fullness.
Now you can grow breasts beyond huge without using Hyper LACT-MAX going over 100% fullness without milking a pawn will have her breasts grow 0.05 severity every 30k ticks (roughly ~30 seconds with on the 4x speed mod), up to 1.6 severity, which is somewhere between colossal and gargantuan (I think?) It might be too slow, maybe, but it's still wayyyyy faster than the original, and goes beyond the original max 0.9 severity.

Added a little "Overfilled" Health heddiff, to represent discomfort and pain common with accumulated milk in the breasts without lactation, as a quick little counterbalance for increasing your pawns breasts for free and also because it makes my dick hard.
The health hediff adds +5% pain and nothing else. It comes coupled with a thought hediff that's -2 mood. Once your pawn is milked, the health hediff goes away the next check (~60k ticks, maybe 30k, don't remember).
The thought remains for a full day, but goes away if they've been milked.
